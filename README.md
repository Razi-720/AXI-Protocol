# AXI Protocol Controller

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) protocol controller using Verilog. The AXI protocol, part of the ARM AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) specification, is widely used for high-performance, high-frequency system-on-chip (SoC) designs. This README provides details on the project setup, design files, and instructions for verification and testing.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains Verilog source files for the AXI protocol controller.
- **testbench/**: Contains testbench files for verifying the functionality of the AXI controller.
- **upf/**: Contains Unified Power Format (UPF) files for low-power design.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation and reports related to the project.
- **scripts/**: Contains simulation and synthesis scripts.
